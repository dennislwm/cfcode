# Introduction
What are Change Sets?

Updating a stack can be a risky action, hence it's important to understand how changes will affect resources.

For example, renaming an SQS Queue will drop and recreate the resource. This could be risky for many reasons, such as the impact on other resources which interact with this resource.

**Change Sets** allow us to preview how changes will impact our resources. In our example, a **Change Set** would inform us that the SQS Queue will be *replaced*.

# Change Sets
There are four operations of a Change Set:
* Create
  * Create a change set for an existing stack by submitting a modified template, and / or parameter values. This does not modify existing stack.
* View
  * After creating, you can view proposed changes.
* Execute
  * Executing a Change Set updates the changes on the existing stack.
* Delete
  * You can delete a Change Set without performing the changes.

What does a Change Set look like?

Resource Change:
* Action
  * Action taken on the resource (Add | Modify | Remove)
* LogicalResourceId & PhysicalResourceId
  * Resource's logical id (`EC2Instance`) and Physical Id (`i-0a29e20fd8a1b308b`)
* ResourceType
  * The type of CF resource (`AWS::EC2::Instance`)
* Replacement
  * For Modify action, will CF delete the old resource and create a new one
* Scope
  * Which resource attribute is triggering the update
* Details
  * Description of the change to the resource

**Example**

Add a tag to an EC2 Instance

```json
"resourceChange": {
  "resourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
  "logicalResourceId": "EC2Instance",
  "physicalResourceId": "i-0a29e20fd8a1b308b",
  "action": "Modify",
  "replacement": "False",
  "details": [
    {
      "target": {
        "name": null,
        "requiresRecreation": "Never",
        "attribute": "Tags"
      },
      "causingEntity": null,
      "evaluation": "Static",
      "changeSource": "DirectModification"
    }
  ],
  "scope": ["Tags"]
}
