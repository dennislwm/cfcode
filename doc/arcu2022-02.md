# Policy and Permissions
At the top level, you may want to create policies for the CloudFormation permissions you want to grant to your DevSecOps. Examples:
* Create a policy to create, update and delete CF stacks.


```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "cloudformation:*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```
At the execution level, you want to create policies for the appropriate permissions to grant to your CF stack (service role) for required operations to the resources in the stack, e.g. create EC2, etc.

> Note: If you don't choose a role, CF uses permissions based on your user credentials.

# Resource Types
We specify our resources, such as VPC, etc in our CF template. But CF does not support every resource in AWS, e.g. new services.

* [AWS resource and property types reference | AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)

**CF Custom Resources** enable you to write custom provisioning logic in templates. For example, you can include resources not available as CF resource types by using Custom Resources.
